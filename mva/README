A few words to get started....

run.sh has the commands for training on one mass point and three
jet multiplicity sub-samples.

After you finish training you can visualize the results using the
tools provided by TMVA. See the directory "test" that is a direct 
copy of ${ROOTSYS}/tmva/test for local use.
It contains a tutorial as well as the tools in question. You do NOT need to
look/modify most of the files.
First use the GUI:
Go in the "test" directory and run
root -l 'TMVAGui.C("pathToFIle/file.root")'
where pathToFIle/file.root is the file that was made after the training.

You will need to look at the README file in the "test" directory and the TMVA
manual.
Forget about the "toy data" as I included some HZZ training/testing ntuples. 
No need to run TMVAClassification.C - TrainMva.C does the training for HZZ and is derived from it.
Note that I have included arguments that provide some convenience 
when dealing with different configurations, so it is not exactly the same.
